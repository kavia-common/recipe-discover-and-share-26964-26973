# Recipe Discovery & Sharing Frontend

A React app following the Ocean Professional style (blue with amber accents). Users can:
- Browse recipes in a grid
- Search by keywords and ingredients
- Filter by cuisine and ingredient tags
- View full recipe details
- Save favorites for quick access

Quick start:
- npm install
- npm start
- Optional: copy .env.example to .env and set REACT_APP_API_URL

Tech:
- React 18, react-router-dom 6
- No UI framework; modern theme via CSS variables (src/theme.css)
- Favorites persisted locally until backend integration

Docs:
- See README_FEATURES.md for architecture, integration points, and assumptions.
